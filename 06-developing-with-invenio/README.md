## Step 1: Inspect Invenio project file structure

Open the project directory and scan the files

## Step 2: Initialize the git repository

Initialize git repo
```commandline
git init
```

Stage changes for commit
```commandline
git add --all
```

Update manifest file
```commandline
check-manifest --update
```

## Step 3: Build the documentation

The documentation has already written basic information for you. However you can expand it by adding your own pages and by writing docstrings, which are very helpful in the later development process. To build the documentation simply run the command below inside your virtualenv. The documentation has to be build any time where are changes in the pages or docstrings.

Build documentation:
```commandline
(my-site)$ python setup.py build_sphinx
```
Now you can open `docs/_build/html/index.html` (so when using the VM: `file:///home/bootcamp/src/my-site/docs/_build/html/index.html`) in the browser to see the documentation:

## Step 4: Running tests

Invenio provides examples of tests in the project's repository:

Before you run tests you need all the development docker services to be up and running:

Run docker services
```commandline
docker-compose up
``` 

To run the tests you can use the test script provided in the repository (the script runs automatically inside virtualenv):

```commandline
./run-tests
```

To run the test functions one by one you should activate the virtualenv of your project and use pytest command, like on the example below:

```commandline
(my-site)$ pytest tests/api/test_api_simple_flow::test_simple_flow
```

## Step 5: End-to-end testing

To enable end-to-end testing you have to set up your environment variables, as well as install proper browser drivers (e2e testing opens up a browser to test UI).

1. Install driver for browser
visit https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases and download latest version for your OS or
if you are using the Bootcamp VM, download and install:
https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases/download/v0.24.0/geckodriver-v0.24.0-linux64.tar.gz

2. Enable E2E testing
```commandline
export E2E="yes"
```

## Step 6: Fix the failing test

Open the file `tests/e2e/test_front_page.py` in your editor.
Edit the string in assert command to match the string in the changed `index.html` template.

Run tests again:
```commandline
./run-tests.sh
```

## Step 7: Installing a new Python dependency

In order to test a new package, simply install it in the virtualenv using `pip` tool:

```commandline
(my-site)$ pip install Pillow
```
This won't add the package to your project. It won't modify the Pipfile or Pipfile.lock.

If you decide not to add `Pillow` to your project, you can simply run:
```commandline
pipenv sync --dev
```
which will restart your virtualenv to initial state, according to actual Pipfile.

On the other hand if you decide to include the `Pillow` package, run:

```commandline
pipenv install Pillow
```

![](images/06-pipenv.png)

The Pipfile and Pipfile.lock will be modified. You should include both files in your repository:

```commandline
git add Pipfile
git add Pipfile.lock
git commit -m "global: added Pillow package"
```

## Extra: Useful development commands

Set up environment variable for debug mode
```commandline
export FLASK_DEBUG=1
```

### Scripts:

Initialise database from scratch
```commandline
./scripts/setup
```

Build project assets, (re)install dependencies
```commandline
./scripts/bootstrap
```

Run invenio server (if $FLASK_DEBUG=1 server refreshes on change of the code)
```commandline
./scripts/server
```

### Pipenv

Installing python dependencies (updated as Pipfile indicates)
```commandline
pipenv sync --dev
```

Activate virtualenv
```commandline
pipenv shell
```

### Docker troubleshooting

To kill and remove all docker containers
```commandline
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q); docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
```
